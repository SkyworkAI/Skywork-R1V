Welcome to the Skywork-R1V repository! Here, you'll find the model weights and inference code for our state-of-the-art open-sourced multimodal reasoning model, enabling advanced visual and text thinking.

## 🔥News

**July 9, 2025: 💥 We released Skywork-R1V3-38B [[🤗 Skywork-R1V3-38B](https://huggingface.co/Skywork/Skywork-R1V3-38B)], the latest and most powerful open-source multimodal reasoning model in the Skywork series, pushing the boundaries of multimodal and cross-disciplinary intelligence. With elaborate RL algorithm in the post-training stage, R1V3 significantly enhances multimodal reasoning ablity and achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks.**

**April 28, 2025**: We released awq quantized version of Skywork R1V2[[🤗 Skywork-R1V2-38B-AWQ](https://huggingface.co/Skywork/Skywork-R1V2-38B-AWQ)], supporting single-card (above 30GB) inference.

 **April 24, 2025**: We released **Skywork-R1V2**, an advanced open-source multimodal reasoning model that demonstrates strong performance across a range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks including MMMU, MMMU-Pro, MathVista, and OlympiadBench.[[🤗 Skywork-R1V2-38B](https://huggingface.co/Skywork/Skywork-R1V2-38B)][[📖R1V2 Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16656)] 
 
**April 9, 2025**: Our technical report is currently available on arxiv: [[Skywork-R1V: Pioneering Multimodal Reasoning with CoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05599)].

**Mar 26, 2025**: We released awq quantized version of Skywork R1V[[🤗 Skywork-R1V-38B-AWQ](https://huggingface.co/Skywork/Skywork-R1V-38B-AWQ)], supporting single-card (above 30GB) inference.

**Mar 18, 2025**: We are thrilled to introduce Skywork R1V, the first industry open-sourced multimodal reasoning model with advanced visual chain-of-thought capabilities, pushing the boundaries of AI-driven vision and logical inference! 🚀

## How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SkyworkAI/Skywork-R1V.git
cd skywork-r1v/inference
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment

```shell
# For Transformers  
conda create -n r1-v python=3.10 && conda activate r1-v  
bash setup.sh  
# For vLLM  
conda create -n r1v-vllm python=3.10 && conda activate r1v-vllm  
pip install -U vllm  
```

### 3. Run the Inference Script

#### Using Transformers
```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1" python inference_with_transformers.py \
    --model_path path \
    --image_paths image1_path \
    --question "your question"
```
#### Using vLLM
```shell
python inference_with_vllm.py \
    --model_path path \
    --image_paths image1_path image2_path \
    --question "your question" \
    --tensor_parallel_size 4
```
